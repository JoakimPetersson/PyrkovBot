PyrkovBot
=====
A fun little IRC bot that uses markov chains to create messages based on user history.

Commands
---
* !markov - The bot creates and posts a message to chat

Other features
---
* run ExportWordList.py to get a text file with all the words in the database and how many times they have showed up. The idea is to use this for creating word clouds (https://worditout.com/word-cloud/create).
